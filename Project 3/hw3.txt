Q1. This improves the functionality of ls for the specified
purpose of the lab. However, now there is a sense of
which flag overrides what, since it will always choose the latter
flag. So the use of the first flag could be considered
redundant.

Q2. If there are any existing scripts or files that utilize the 
aforementioned utility of the ls -a -A (or vice versa)
situation, then problems may occur. Additionally, when
Going through subdirectories recursively, this would become
an issue.

Q3. If you run the program with a null input/empty input
 such as with /dev/null, then you get an indexing error,
  essentially like an out of bounds error for the list.
  Because the empty file is being operated on under the
  assumption it has something in it, we get a seq error:
 
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if
    seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Q4. The error is:
  File "randline.py", line 66
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
This is most likely because Python3 updated tuple parameter passing with
exceptions (ie, automatic tuple unpacking). In python 2, the parameters
for an exception were iterable, and you could go through them by iterating
over there exception. Essentially it would auto-unpack tuples passed to the
exception. This was changed in python 3 and you can only have one thing in
the exception.
