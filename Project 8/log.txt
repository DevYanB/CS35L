//First step was to connect to the BeagleBone Wifi, which allows
//me to configure the wifi via a pop up webpage that requested 
//SSID and password.

//After passing in the credentials for a private hotspot, my BeagleBone was connected to my wifi.

//I then connected to that private network through my laptop and ssh'ed into the BeagleBone:

////////---BEAGLEBONE SETUP---////////

//First step is to generate a pulbic.private rsa key pair

root@beaglebone:~# ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/root/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
79:22:18:10:fb:ff:ae:8e:57:8e:42:5e:78:9b:b9:bb root@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:

//Now that I had a public/private keypair, I started set up for my lab partner

//First, I add a user to the BeagleBone, with home directory as RishabS with user Rishab
root@beaglebone:~# sudo useradd -d /home/RishabS -m Rishab

//I then gave him as passphrase specific to his account
root@beaglebone:~# sudo passwd Rishab
Enter new UNIX password: [PSSWD: asdf1234]
Retype new UNIX password: [PSSWD: asdf1234]
passwd: password updated successfully

//Once I had done that, I have to enable ssh'ing
root@beaglebone:~# cd /home/RishabS/
root@beaglebone:~# sudo mkdir .ssh
root@beaglebone:~# sudo chown -R Rishab .ssh
root@beaglebone:~# sudo chmod 700 .ssh

//Next step is to remove the password authentication requirement for him 
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Devyan@192.168.43.109's password:

Number of key(s) added:        1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'Devyan@192.168.43.109'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

//Then I added the private key
➜  ~ ssh-add
Identity added: /Users/devyanbiswas/.ssh/id_rsa (devyanbiswas@Devyans-MacBook-Pro.local)

//Login (this does not require passphrase from me anymore since we added private and public key then
added to the server!)
