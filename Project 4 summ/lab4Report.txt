1. I get a copy of diffutils directly:
$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

2. I cd into the diffutils directory and use git log to get a log of the changes:
$ git log > git-log.txt

3. I use git tag to get the tags:
$ git tag > git-tags.txt

4. Searched for maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this' and then created the patch:
$ emacs git-log.txt
(In git-log.txt) M-c-s maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
$ git format-patch -1 --stdout 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f  > quote-patch.txt

5. I looked at the git-tags.txt file and got the name of the branch to check out, then switched into it
$ emacs git-tags.txt
$ git checkout "v3.0"
...
HEAD is now at 022cd5c... version 3.0

6. Now in the v3 branch, I do the patch:
$ patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
...

7. Used git status to see what's happened:
$ git status
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

8 & 9. For all the files without a .c tag in the abovie changed but not updated section, I used vc-revert on the files
(emacs) C-x v u

For the .c files, I revert all the changes in the comments, but keep the changes in any c code I find, using C-c C-c to check each hunk in the .c file. To revert the relevant hunks in the .c files, I used the C-u C-c C-a command in emacs for each hunk.
(emacs) C-x v = //using vc-diff to check the changes
(emacs) C-c C-c
(emacs) C-u C-c C-a

10. 
$ emacs src/*.c.rej
Problems with diff3.c and diff.c, seems liek the lines dont match up!
I then went into the files and manually made the changes from ` to ' specified in the emacs diff log of rej

11. 
$git clean -f //to remove untracked files
git status does, in fact, only report 6 changed files, meaning our edits should be correct

12.
$ git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
$ wc -l quote-3.0-patch.txt
326 ... //matches up!

13. According to the README-hacking:
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

14. Sanity check (using the version of diffutils just built)
./src/diff . -
