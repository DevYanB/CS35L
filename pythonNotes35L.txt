Python lists
- can reverse index
- can hold values of different types

Python add lists: +
- In c++, had to copy over all unique elements from one

Dict in python
- Is a hash table
- dict = {} //empty dictionary
- Keys are unique, values are not! Keys are immutable(strings, numbers, tuples)

Set
- Unordered collection with no duplicates
- no key, only values
- set_name = {e1, e2} //doing {} makes it into a dictionary

Python randline.py script:

#!/usr/bin/python //tells interpreter to use python

import random, sys //imports libraries random, and sys(like stdl in c and iostream in c++)
from optparse import OptionParser //import a part of a library

[LOOK AT RANDLINE.PY IN P3 FOLDER IN LNXSRV]

def chooseline(self): #self is a default, so technically 0 parameter function like in c++
- self is a keyword, self is an isntance of the class (ie like an object)
- hidden parameter, like "this" in C++, only self must be said explicitly

python randline.py assign3.html //prints a random line from assign3.html
python randline.py assign3.html -n 3 //prints 3 random lines from assign3.html
